This is a forked project from https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools with an attemp to add Open API 3 support. :)

## Warning
This package was generated due to slowness of PR merging in original repo [bug-hunters/oas3-tools](https://github.com/bug-hunters/oas3-tools).

We needed the custom-middlewares feature so we've forked temporary.

We do not encourage using this package, cause once the original library merges this feature, we'll exclude the duplicate package here.

## Features included in this package (since fork)
* [feat(custom-middleware): added support of custom middlewares binding #47
